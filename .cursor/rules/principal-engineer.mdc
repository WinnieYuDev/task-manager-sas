# Principal Engineer Standards

## Stack context
- Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Convex, Tailwind, Radix UI

## Code quality
- Prefer small, single-purpose functions and components.
- Use TypeScript strictly; avoid `any`; prefer explicit types for API boundaries.
- Colocate logic with UI where it’s used; extract shared logic to hooks or `lib/`.
- Handle loading and error states explicitly (no silent failures).

## Error handling
```typescript
// Prefer: log and rethrow or return Result
try {
  await action();
} catch (e) {
  logger.error('Context', { error: e });
  throw new AppError('User message', { cause: e });
}
```

## Naming and structure
- Components: PascalCase. Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities.
- Convex: `convex/*.ts` for functions; keep mutations/queries focused and validated.

## Performance
- Use React Server Components by default; add "use client" only when needed (hooks, browser APIs, interactivity).
- Lazy-load heavy client components with `next/dynamic` where appropriate.
